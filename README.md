# Grid

Grid is an application that utilizes earth science data base to 
  calculate power production based on geo-location for different power types.
The main focus of grid is the comparison between solar and wind farms, however further updates could
  provide information on GeoThermal, and Tidal.

## Note

This project was designed for a second year Software Engineering Class. The project was developed through research of energy generation schemas, however was not optimized, or tested on the basis of real world data of the schemas outputs. The task more so illustraits development attributes such as: Utilization of algorithms learnt within classes durring that year (specifically handeling large data sets through graphs), as well as MVC architecture use, and team development on a software system.
